# Introduction

The Consumer Identity Resolution initiative aims to enable the tracking of consumer journeys by creating an Analytical Identifier that remains consistent across different relationships, lifecycle events, and products. This identifier will be tied to all consumer interaction events, aiding in the development of a consumer graph.

# Scope

The initial phase of the project focuses on customers, applicants, and direct mail solicited prospects. This will be extended to authorized buyers and identity theft protection customers in Phase 2. Digital prospect resolution will be addressed in the future, with the data model and design being flexible to accommodate future needs.

# Approach

ACXIOM was chosen as the vendor to help resolve consumer identities. While ACXIOM drives consumer record creation, internal review processes will handle exceptions and conflicting scenarios. This is a batch solution that runs daily or weekly, depending on file frequency.

# Current State

Currently, there are no individual identifiers associated with applicants and prospects, making it impossible to create a consumer graph.

# Future State

Once a consumer identity is established, all consumer activities can be tracked from solicitation to the end of the relationship across all products. This will provide insights into user behavior and assist in effective marketing and servicing strategies.

# Data Exchange Process

## High-Level Data Exchange

The data exchange between Discover and ACXIOM involves several processes, including application matching, prospect matching, and customer matching.

## Application Matching Process

1. **Applicant to Customer Pre-Matching:** Links applicants to customers using Discover IDs and PII verification.
2. **Application Customer Lookup:** Identifies if an applicant is an existing Discover customer.
3. **Application Consolidated PDB Match:** Identifies if an applicant is a Discover direct mail prospect or exists in ACXIOM's prospect knowledge base.

## Prospect Matching Process

1. **Prospect Identity Match:** Associates an identifier with direct mail prospects.
2. **PDB Shift Communication:** Communicates any shift in identifiers identified by ACXIOM.

## Customer Matching Process

1. **Portfolio Match:** Ties a PDB identifier to all current Discover customers.
2. **Customer PDB Match:** A weekly process to associate PDB identifiers with new customer relationships.

# Egress and Ingress Processes

## Egress Process (Discover to ACXIOM)

Discover sends a file of applicants to ACXIOM daily for individual/household ID append. Restricted data elements are detokenized, and files are PGP encrypted before being pushed to ACXIOM.

## Ingress Process (ACXIOM to Discover)

ACXIOM pushes files and control files to Discover daily and weekly. Files are ingested, tokenized, and loaded to Snowflake via Cloud Data Fabric.

# Detailed Data Flow Design

The consumer ID generation process is a weekly process executed after all expected files for the week are delivered. Each record and its corresponding individual identifiers are compared with the current state in Discover's system to determine actions.

# Consumer Action Consolidation

Each record received as part of the consumer identity determination process is run through logic to determine the necessary action. Actions are aggregated at the individual ID level to identify all actions to be executed.

# Different Actions

There are seven potential actions based on the record's relationship and individual ID:

- **New Consumer (NEW):** Assigned if a record contains an individual ID not existing in the system.
- **Existing Consumer with a New Relationship (NEW-NOT-NEW):** Assigned if a record contains an individual ID existing in the system but representing a new relationship.
- **Consumer Split (SPLIT):** Assigned if a record's individual ID has shifted.
- **Consumer Merge (MERGE):** Assigned if a record's individual ID has shifted to an existing ID.
- **Consumer Split Merge (SPLIT-MERGE):** Assigned if a record's individual ID has shifted and needs to be merged with a different record.
- **Consumer Reassignment (SHIFT):** Assigned if a record's individual ID has shifted to a new ID.
- **Consumer Reassignment (SHIFT-SPLIT):** An edge case of the SHIFT scenario.

# Prioritization of Actions

Actions are prioritized to ensure the correct action is executed on the individual ID. Actions related to consumer record creation or reassignment cannot coexist with actions not tied to creation/reassignment.

# Consumer Relationship Cross-Reference Management

The consumer relationship cross-reference management involves detailed data flow design and table definitions to ensure accurate tracking and management of consumer relationships.

# Testing Strategy

## Data Exchange Validation

Data exchange validation includes file layout validation, count validation, and decision validation to ensure the correct decisions are made on Perm IDs based on PDBs assigned.

## Process Monitoring

Approximately 50 Snowflake dashboards are monitored weekly to ensure the Consumer Identity Process runs as expected.

## Data Exchange Patterns for Testing in Dev

Data is exchanged between Discover and ACXIOM to test rule execution in the Dev region. Data is sent to ACXIOM in the PROD space with true PII for applicants and returned to Discover in the Dev region with masked PII.

## Application Data Exchange Process

The application data exchange process involves sending applicant data daily and receiving matched data from ACXIOM.

# Conclusion

The Consumer Identity Resolution initiative is a comprehensive effort to enhance customer tracking and engagement by creating a consistent Analytical Identifier. This identifier will provide valuable insights into consumer behavior, aiding in effective marketing and servicing strategies.
