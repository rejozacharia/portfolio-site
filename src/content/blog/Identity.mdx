# Introduction

The graph database solution lets us associate multi-dimensional data such as customer email, phone, physical address, product and account relationships, as well as interaction events like support calls, chats, emails and clickstream views, cutting across layers of multiple products and their siloed systems. In doing so, it enables us to visualize customer behavior better and identify and persist new associations that existing data systems find difficult to capture today.

By connecting fragmented data into cohesive journey maps, these graphs will help us unlock household insights, optimize lifecycle engagement, drive acquisition and re-engagement strategies and deepen consumer relationships at scale. In the following slides, we’ll expound on why graphs suited our particular context, and how we arrived at our setup.

# Why Graph is the solution

A typical customer journey we navigate is intricate and multi-dimensional( as shown below), presenting numerous points where leads can disengage and we can re-establish engagement. This complexity is further compounded by the existence of various business lines and their corresponding products.

While the abundance of customer data and interactions offers significant insights for strategic decision-making, it is contingent on us effectively modelling this data to derive meaningful conclusions.

Tabular data (relational databases) fall short in that :

- ** Information is collected as seemingly separate occurrences sourced from different systems, each employing different identifiers.
- ** Analyzing the customer journey by sifting through tabular data is often more complex than a visual depiction of the events.
- ** Monitoring temporal aspects of the customer journey for dynamic analysis is challenging when relying on a collection of combined tables.

# Usecases of building an effective Identity graph in Marketing
A well-designed Identity graph, associating both profiles and multi-channel events to an identity addresses several next-gen usecases:

- **Multi-touch Attribution across channels**: Prospect may be marketed to through a particular channel but may appear to arrive on landing page organically – multi-touch attribution helps to attribute (even fractionally) conversion to right channels, enabling accurate measurement of CPA.

- **Household-level Marketing and Influence analysis**: Prospective customers may drop off an in-progress application to do more research on the product. Intelligence on customers’ interactions with our webpage on their personal devices will help us understand their areas of concern and reach out to them with personalized information – proactively helping them move forward.
- **Enable new re-engagement strategies**: Row-level security, data source credentials, and user permissions are managed centrally on Tableau Server, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected without limiting collaboration.
- **Identify known individuals even with partial information**: Broad-market prospects with limited /missing/incorrectly recorded contact information can be matched to existing customer profiles using partial attribute matches  - helping us find the best way to reach out to them and re-engage
- **Advanced personalization**: By leveragng ML feature stores and signals derived from events associated in graphs, very advanced offer propensity models can be put in place to improve profitability
- **Next-best action** : Determine next best action, in marketing & servicing processes, based on omni-channel events, associated in the graph
- **Datasource to Martech platforms** : A well-established identity graph can be an incredible foundational data structure for platform like CDPs 

# Design & implementation

## Data Model

Data model is first piece of the puzzle to design an identity graph. Identifying potential usecases also helps in the design, as performance depends on design and design depends on queries run against the graph, which in turn depends on usecases.

Few other guiding principles to consider :-
- ** Enhanced insights derived from the graph are used to augment benefits of the existing consumer identity framework.
- ** Classifying features as nodes, properties, or relationship properties is driven by the business questions to be answered.
- ** Effective model to represent and persist graph derived relationships back into a relational structure for downstream analysis.
- ** Prioritize use-cases depending on whether a deterministic association solution is sufficient or GDS is necessary.
- ** Oversight of data storage, retention, and privacy compliance in accordance with CCPA and GDPR regulations.

## Data Pipeline

Data pipeline design can vary significantly on whether implementation is on cloud vs on-prem. A cloud implementation might leverage PySpark/EMR for ETL, sourcing base data from Snowflake(as shown below). Neo4J GDS(Graph Data Science) will need to be leveraged to determine synthetic groupings(such as family-name based households) or linkages (probabilistic linkage of a web event to an identity)

#### Tactical Optimizations 
- ** A data aggregation strategy aimed at managing high-volume events while preserving essential information e.g. web interaction events.
- ** Reduce unnecessary node scanning through predicate pushdown – coding common filtering criteria as relationship labels or properties.
- For tracking direct mail offers, we found it more effective to code channel type as a relationship instead of a property of the offer node, prioritizing relationship properties over node properties.
- ** Transforming text features into embeddings prior to graph storage – enhanced flexibility by enabling more versatile fuzzy matching queries.
- ** A versatile data model designed to support all create, update, and delete operations.
- ** Cleaning & standardizing data in before importing it into the graph - to avoid dense nodes and irrelevant traversals that can slow memory and traversals
- Test or fabricated email IDs, visitor IDs from recognized bot IPs, non-standard/unrecognizable phone numbers etc. can be identified and excluded to reduce.

# Conclusion

A sophisticated enterprise-wide Identity graph can super-charge marketing and CX experience efforts and lead to step-change impacts on profitability. The effort around creating such a graph shouldnt be under-estimated but with diligent focus on data quality/governance, it can be accomplished.
