## Hardware Overview

### CPU & Motherboard
For a NAS that also runs VMs and Docker, a multi-core, low-power processor is ideal. Many hobbyist builds opt for an Intel Core i3-12100T (~35 W TDP) paired with an ATX motherboard offering at least eight SATA ports or an LSI HBA for expansion.

### Memory
While Unraid doesn’t strictly require ECC RAM, running VMs and containers benefits from ample memory. A baseline of 16 GB DDR4 is common, with plans to expand to 32 GB if you host multiple Ubuntu VMs or memory-intensive services.

### Storage: Parity, Data & Cache
Data Drives: Use NAS-rated HDDs (e.g., Seagate IronWolf) in a parity-protected array to guard against drive failures.

Parity Drive: At least one parity disk—ideally the largest size in your array—to protect your data.

Cache Pool: A pair of NVMe SSDs configured in RAID 1 serves as the cache pool, accelerating writes and supporting Docker image storage.

### Power Supply & Cooling
A high-efficiency (80 Plus Gold) PSU around 650–750 W (e.g., Corsair RM750x) provides ample headroom. Ensure good case airflow with at least two intake and one exhaust fan; dust filters help keep drives healthy.

### Networking
While 1 GbE suffices for backups and light use, consider adding a 2.5 GbE or 10 GbE NIC for faster local transfers, especially if streaming high-bitrate media or running multiple VMs.

## Software Setup

### Unraid OS & Array Configuration
Install Unraid OS on a USB flash drive and boot your machine into it.

Assign array disks—select your parity and data drives, then start the array.

Configure the cache pool in Settings → Cache Devices, pairing your SSDs in mirrored mode for write cache.

Enable user shares, choosing “Prefer” or “Only” to store certain shares on the cache for performance.

### Docker Containers
Unraid’s built-in Docker support lets you deploy containers via the Community Applications plugin. Common services:

*   Plex Media Server for streaming.
*   Nextcloud for private cloud file syncing and collaboration.
*   Pi-Hole or AdGuard Home for network-wide ad blocking.

Each container stores its appdata on the SSD cache for fast I/O and moves data to the HDD array on idle.

### Ubuntu Virtual Machines
Use Unraid’s KVM manager to spin up Ubuntu VMs:

*   Create VM with 2+ vCPUs and 4–8 GB RAM for light services, more if needed.
*   Attach virtual disks—store VMs on cache for performance or directly on the array for larger storage.
*   Pass-through devices (e.g., GPU for transcoding) as required.

Ubuntu VMs can run specialized workloads like self-hosted code repositories, CI runners, or backup services.

## Home Automation & Private Cloud

### Home Assistant Integration
Run Home Assistant in Docker or VM to manage your Ecobee thermostat and other IoT devices. Store state databases on the cache pool and backup configurations regularly to a Nextcloud share.

### Secure Remote Access & Web Hosting
Reverse Proxy: Use Nginx Proxy Manager in Docker to route external traffic to services (Nextcloud, WordPress, etc.) behind dynamic DNS.

TLS Certificates: Automate Let’s Encrypt issuance for secure HTTPS.

Firewall & VPN: Employ Unraid’s built-in firewall rules and/or WireGuard plugin for secure remote VPN access.

## Conclusion
Building a home NAS server on Unraid combines the flexibility of Docker and VMs with robust, parity-protected storage and SSD caching. Whether you’re streaming media via Plex, syncing files with Nextcloud, automating your home with Home Assistant, or self-hosting web services, this setup delivers performance, expandability, and reliability—while keeping everything under your control.
